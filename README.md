# ***So how is this different from the other DRG save transfer programs?***
I'm glad you asked.

Firstly, *Molly's Game-Save M.U.L.E.* is clearly the prettiest.

Secondly, other programs I've seen will determine the file with the most progress by considering only the most recent file write.

This could potentially cause a file with less progress (if opened most recently) to overwrite a file with more progress.

### So we punched the guy in R&D until he agreed to come up with a solution.
### Prioritize file size!

## Installation
Download and open the file named "Molly's Game-Save M.U.L.E..msi"

Program will be found in the Start Menu or via the desktop shortcut created by the installer.

### **Done!**

For the smoothest experience, make sure _Deep Rock Galactic_ is installed on both Steam and Game Pass, 
and that each version of the game has been launched at least once prior to launching _Molly's Game-Save M.U.L.E_.

This will ensure that both save files have been created; both must be present to initiate the transfer.

## How to Use
### Auto-Sync
Click *Sync Most Progress* to let Molly figure out which file has the most progress.

You'll see a message detailing which file (Steam or Xbox) has been chosen and why.

Click *Yes* and your progress will be automatically transferred to the other platform!

### Manual Transfer
Select *Steam to Xbox* OR *Xbox to Steam*

Click *Yes* and your progress will be automatically transferred!

### _What if the game is installed somewhere other than my (C:) Drive?_
Click _Set Folders_, click the Steam or Xbox tab, and click the _Choose Save Folder_ option.

Select the folder that contains your save file.

Your settings are saved!
